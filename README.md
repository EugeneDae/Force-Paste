Force Paste.app
===============

**[Download](https://github.com/EugeneDae/Force-Paste/releases/download/1.0/Force-Paste.zip)** (≈15KB, zip) + [related blog post and discussion](http://d43.me/blog/1741/paste-text-even-when-prohibited-in-os-x-password-dialogs-etc/)

Little AppleScript application for OS X which allows pasting text even when it’s not allowed (password dialogs etc). It uses virtual keyboard to type in the text from your clipboard. In other words, it tricks the program that asks for your input into thinking that you’re actually typing on your keyboard.

Use from the Dock or Scripts menu.
